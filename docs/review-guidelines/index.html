We provide access to identified and connected households. By adding your app to our App Library, you can reach 20+ million targeted households with one single app, no customization per device or operator needed.</p><p>By simply developing your app once, using web standards in an open SDK, you are able to publish it across devices. Our Application Platform allows interaction between apps running on multiple devices simultaneously.</p><p>The biggest challenge is to make sure the functionality offered through the SDK is up to date. Many innovations are done, making sure your app stays up and running and keeps you ahead of competition.</p><p>The Application Platform and SDK enable you to launch, operate and manage your apps across operators and devices. No need to longer maintain many application versions of one single app for different devices or operator networks. We will do the lifecycle management, Q&amp;A and testing for you.</p><p>Whether you are a first time developer or a large team of experienced programmers, we are excited that you are creating apps for our platform and want to help you understand our guidelines so you can be confident your app will get through the review process quickly.</p><h1 id="before-you-submit">Before You Submit</h1><p>To help your app approval go as smoothly as possible, review the common guidelines listed below that can trigger a rejection. Make sure you check every item on the list to have a good start.<br>Make sure you:</p><ul><li>Test your app for crashes and bugs.</li><li>Ensure that all app information and metadata is complete and accurate.</li><li>Provide an active demo account and login information that might be needed to review your app.</li><li>Be sure to use HTTPS and proper CORS headers for all you API requests.</li><li>Enable backend services so that they’re live and accessible during review.</li><li>Include detailed explanations of non-obvious features.</li><li>If we’re not able to access part of your app because it’s geo-locked or otherwise restricted, provide a link to a video of the functionality.</li><li>Check whether your app follows guidance in other documentation, such as:<br><a href="../getting-started/">Development Guidelines</a><br><a href="../design-guide/#guidelines">Design Guidelines</a><br><a href="../design-guide/#branding">Brand and Marketing Guidelines</a></li><li>Run the <a href="../Master Test Plan.xlsx">Master Test Plan</a> on your app. Only if the app passes that test you can make a <a href="https://metrological.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/create/9" target="_blank">QA request</a>.</li></ul><h3 id="general">1.
